*The sun went out seventeen cycles ago.*  
*The corridors remember. The walls whisper. The terminal flickers.*

**You shouldn't be here.**

---

## What Is This?

A terminal. A dungeon. A question with no answer.

Type commands into the green phosphor screen. Watch the ASCII corridors materialize. Listen to what the darkness tells you. The interface is old—like it's been waiting, untouched, in some forgotten server room since 1987.

**Do** things. **Say** things. Neither matters. Both matter.

The loading bar fills. Then it collapses inward, eating itself. This should tell you something.

## How to Enter

1. Clone this repository (if it lets you)
2. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser
3. Wait for the skull
4. Press any key when you're ready
5. You won't be ready

Or run a local server if the audio refuses to play. The ambience helps. Or makes it worse.

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Navigate to `localhost:8000/frontend/`

## What You'll Find

- Green text on black nothing
- Corridors rendered in characters
- Commands that echo back at you
- A blinking cursor that never stops
- The hum of old machinery
- Something about the sun

The screen flickers like dying fluorescent lights. This is intentional. Everything is intentional. Nothing is intentional.

## Controls

`Do` / `Say` — toggle the command mode  
`Enter` — submit  
`↑` `↓` — your words, returned to you  
`Escape` — there is no escape, only settings

## A Warning

This is not finished. The dungeon grows in the dark. More rooms are coming. More questions. The same answer, repeated in different voices.

Maybe you'll find the sun. Maybe the sun will find you first.
